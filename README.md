# Stormworks---Enhanced-Civilian-Traffic-A.I.-
Remember to use the Experimental branch for testing and only merge it with this one for when it's time to update it on the Steam Workshop.

A replacement for the 'default ai' and 'default ai aircraft' currently being used in the game Stormworks Build &amp; Rescue. The current iteration that was made by Geometa some years ago hasn't been very well maintained, is quite buggy and lacks some QoL features that could easily be added that would also make it compatible with our Bungeling Raiders (Hostile AI) addon.
